# Work Done Note

Date: 2026-04-15
Repository: IA_survey

## 0) Process rule hardening (uncommitted)

### Changed
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` to require:
  - a mandatory final task report for every change,
  - a mandatory update to `WORK_DONE_NOTE.md` for every change.
- Defined required fields for each work note entry:
  - date,
  - what changed,
  - why,
  - files touched.

### Why
- To ensure consistent reporting and persistent project history for every task, including small edits.

### Files touched
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `WORK_DONE_NOTE.md`

## 00) Mandatory commit workflow (uncommitted)

### Changed
- Updated `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with a required commit rule.
- Added the requirement to always commit task-related changes after verification/tests succeed.
- Defined commit constraints: stage only related files, use a clear message, and avoid leaving task-related edits uncommitted.

### Why
- To ensure every completed change is traceable in git history and reduce risk of forgotten local modifications.

### Files touched
- `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
- `WORK_DONE_NOTE.md`

## 1) Multi-page architecture (committed)

### Changed
- Updated `scripts/update.py` to support three profiles:
  - `general`
  - `enterprise`
  - `discovery`
- Added dedicated query sets:
  - `GENERAL_SEARCH_QUERIES`
  - `ENTERPRISE_SEARCH_QUERIES`
  - `OPTIMIZED_GENERAL_SEARCH_QUERIES`
- Added `--profile` CLI flag to select which dataset to update.
- Added per-profile metadata persistence in JSON (`page_name`, `page_label`, `page_description`, `search_queries`, `last_updated`).

### Why
- To run different search strategies for different page goals and keep each generated page traceable to its query strategy.

## 2) New datasets and generated pages (committed)

### Changed
- Added data files:
  - `data/tools-enterprise.json`
  - `data/tools-discovery.json`
- Updated `data/tools.json` metadata for the general page.
- Updated generator `scripts/generate.py` to build multiple pages.
- Generated/updated pages:
  - `index.html`
  - `enterprise.html`
  - `discovery.html`

### Why
- To publish separate curated views (general, enterprise, discovery) from independent datasets.

## 3) UI updates across pages (committed)

### Changed
- Added a page selector in the header of each generated page.
- Added page-type information block (label + description).
- Added popup/modal showing:
  - search queries used by the current page
  - last update date
- Fixed template formatting/escaping and indentation issues in `scripts/generate.py` so generation succeeds.

### Why
- To improve navigation between pages and provide transparency about sourcing and freshness.

## 4) Rule for mandatory change notes (uncommitted)

### Changed
- Added `.github/copilot-instructions.md` with rule:
  - every task must include a short note explaining what changed and why.

### Why
- To enforce consistent documentation of modifications for every future request.

## 5) Commit reference

- Commit: `48ae561`
- Message: `feat: add enterprise and discovery pages with profile-based queries`
- Branch used during implementation: `feature/mulitple_page`
